AS A web developer  
I WANT to showcase my work and skills in a professional portfolio  
SO THAT potential employers and clients can easily view my projects, learn about my background, and contact me for opportunities  
```

## Description:
This portfolio application was thoughtfully designed and developed to present my web projects, resume, and technical skills to prospective employers, clients, and collaborators. Built with React, an open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, the application leverages React’s component-based architecture, efficient virtual DOM rendering, and declarative syntax to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience within a single-page application.

The front end is structured using functional components and React Hooks, enabling modular, reusable code and efficient state management. React Router is used for client-side navigation, allowing users to move between sections—such as About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume—without full page reloads. The UI is styled with modern CSS, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility across devices. Form validation is handled within React, providing real-time feedback for user input in the contact form. The application also integrates third-party libraries for enhanced features, such as badge displays and date formatting.

Currently, the portfolio is entirely front-end, but I plan to integrate a backend framework in the future to enable direct message submissions through the contact page. React’s flexibility and growing popularity make it an ideal choice for scalable UI development, while its focus on the View layer allows for easy integration with a variety of backend technologies and middleware as needed.
